# [`trek`](https://github.com/jfischoff/trek)

- I can simplify `CmdLineSpec.hs`. I can remove all of the `listApplications` stuff.
- I should remove it all together. Better to make things simplier while I am still figuring out the interface.
  I can always bring it back.
- I don't get this `apply :: [FilePath]` function.
