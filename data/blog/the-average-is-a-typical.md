People are better at probability instinctually then we tend to give them credit for. If you ask someone that is uneducated whether flipping heads 50 times in a row is less likely then flipping 50 times and get 25 heads and 25 tails they will tell you that 25 heads and 25 tails is more likely. If you ask someone who is educated they will tell you they are equal likely but that is incorrect. There is one way to get all heads and but the number of sequences that have 25 heads and 25 tails ~ 125 trillion.

The likelihood of getting all heads is 1/125 trillion. The permutations with 25 head and 25 tails making up the typical set. They are the most likely to be sampled elements. We instinctively understand that but are taught to surpress that instinct. Instead we are taught to treat all sequences as equal, which they are, but we are just thing about the typical set because it is what matters.

The idea of the typical set, or the elements that are most likely to be sampled, is what I think leads people to dislike politicans in general. The you'll never meet a person average in all qualities. You'll never meet a person with completely average views.

Yet politicans espouse entire average views devoid of extremes. Their views are not offensive to at least half of the populations. This appear fake. No one is like that. It is not in the typical set. They are lying about what they believe. They can't be trusted.

Trump and AOC read as two normal.
