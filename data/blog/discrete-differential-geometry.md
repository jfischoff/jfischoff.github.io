discreting is the process of taking some in a smooth setting scale it by the mesh

I don't really get the idea of the angle discretization.

discreting is somewhat arbitrary. different choices can be useful for solving different problems.

boundaries create surfaces. The dimension is one less than the shape.

lots of ways to make a space look locally euclidean. I assume they have different global properities.

We are talking topology. We need to understand topological disks.

the disk can be deformed. Can be n-dimensional.

abstract simplicial complexes

simplical complex is a n-dimensional mesh

abstract means ?


A family Δ of non-empty finite subsets of a set S is an abstract simplicial complex if, for every set X in Δ, and every non-empty subset Y ⊆ X, Y also belongs to Δ.

If the set is there, so are the subsets.
